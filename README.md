# Project 3: Logic and Classical Planning

## Introduction

In this project, we utilize simple Python functions to generate logical sentences describing Pacman physics (pacphysics) and employ a SAT solver, pycosat, to solve various logical inference tasks. These tasks include:
- **Planning**: Generating action sequences for Pacman to reach goal locations and eat all the dots.
- **Localization**: Determining Pacman's location on the map given a local sensor model.
- **Mapping**: Building the map from scratch.
- **SLAM**: Simultaneous localization and mapping.

The assignment includes an autograder to facilitate grading answers locally. Use the command:
```sh
python autograder.py
```

## Evaluation

Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Adhere to function and class naming conventions to avoid autograder issues. Your implementation's correctness will ultimately determine your score. 

## Academic Integrity

Submit original work. We will use code similarity detection tools to identify plagiarism.

## Getting Help

Utilize course resources, including office hours, section, and discussion forums for support.

## Grade Weighting

The project score totals 100 points. Each section's score is multiplied by 4, with the last question offering 2 extra credit points.

## Tasks Overview

### Expr Class

- **sentence1()**: Represents a conjunction of three given sentences.
- **sentence2()**: Represents a conjunction of four given sentences.
- **sentence3()**: Creates symbols and an expression encoding three English sentences as propositional logic.
- **findModelCheck()**: Mimics `findModel` output.
- **entails(premise, conclusion)**: Determines if the premise entails the conclusion.
- **plTrueInverse(assignments, inverse_statement)**: Evaluates the inverse statement given assignments.

### Logic Workout

- **atLeastOne(literals)**: Returns an expression true if at least one literal is true.
- **atMostOne(literals)**: Returns an expression true if at most one literal is true.
- **exactlyOne(literals)**: Returns an expression true if exactly one literal is true.

### Pacphysics and Satisfiability

- **pacmanSuccessorAxiomSingle**: Defines conditions for Pacmanâ€™s location at time t.
- **pacphysicsAxioms**: Generates pacphysics axioms.
